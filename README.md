## Welcome ##

Welcome to the Lemon-Tree project. Lemon-Tree is a "one-stop shop" software suite for module network inference that aims to make module network methods available to a broader community of users while simultaneously
facilitating and encouraging collaborations between developers. Module networks are probabilistic graphical models which consist of modules of coregulated genes and their regulatory programs, and they can be inferred from integrated genomic data compendia (including gene expression, microRNA expression, copy number variation, and more) measured in a large number of individuals or experimental conditions.

For more information, please consult the asociated [wiki](https://github.com/eb00/lemon-tree/wiki) pages for this project.
